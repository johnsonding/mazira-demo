					<h1>5 Reasons to Work for a Startup Company</h1>

					<div class="subTitle">by Mei Rao</div>
					<div class="date">2013/07/09</div>
					<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A lot of my friends asked me why I chose to work for Mazira, a startup company located in Iowa City, while I had another offer from a company that is stable and with global foot print. I like Mazira not only because I am interested in its core business, data transformation, but also because of its nature as a startup company. Here are the five reasons why “I am LOVING it.“</p>
<h3 id="awesome-atmosphere">Awesome Atmosphere</h3>
<p>In a startup, employers and coworkers often work closely together and get to know each other very well. It’s just like a big family rather than a company.  Instead of looking at my boss as if he were standing from a pedestal, I get to interact with him, brainstorming and hashing out ideas with him every day. At Mazira, we have morning standup meetings for everyone to talk about what he or she is working on and whether he or she needs any help.</p>
<h3 id="wide-ranging-experience-and-career-options">Wide-ranging Experience and Career Options</h3>
<p>Working in a startup company means you have to turn your hand to a bit of everything, which provides invaluable insight into different aspects of running a company, gives you opportunities to try something new every time and shows how important collaboration and communication are in an organization. As an MBA student with five years working experience, I am helping Mazira with its business analysis and development. I got a chance to lead Mazira’s website design and SEO project.  I also worked with the engineers to find out the optimum marketing strategy to bring technical people, who might be our potential users, to our website. It’s not just resume building. You learn practical skills that speed up your career path.</p>
<h3 id="rewards-and-incentives">Rewards and Incentives</h3>
<p>Maybe you think that most startup jobs won&#39;t pay as well as some of the larger corporate jobs. I have found that working at a startup company offers a different type of reward: an incentive-based system that isn&#39;t based on money, but rather in skills attained and opportunities seized. The experience will outweigh the pay cut. I guarantee it. Meanwhile, it is also possible that getting in with a company in its infant stages might translate into great financial rewards. As the company grows and becomes more profitable, you will receive bonuses, better employee benefits and, you might, also receive stock options, which are intended to reward you for being there from the beginning. And you might also have the chance to design your own compensation structure. At Mazira, good ideas are always welcome and your contribution can have an immediate impact. For example Ross, my boss, just recently accepted my suggestion to give a certain amount of cash bonus for anyone who joined social media marketing campaign. This means that the workers get compensated for the extra mile that they go for their company, and gives them opportunities to grow in social media marketing.</p>
<h3 id="opportunities-to-learn-from-true-innovators">Opportunities to Learn from True Innovators</h3>
<p>Startup companies provide you opportunities to work closely with a group of smart, motivated, talented and passionate people. At Mazira, I learn something every day. Most of the people who start their own business have a different mental than those who have never gone off to create something of their own. They enjoy finding problem and thinking of innovative and original ways of addressing it. Because of this innovative nature, entrepreneurs are some of the best people to learn from. And you will also learn, create and improve your own way of innovation. Before joining Mazira, I knew nothing about data transformation or how to use big data to help a specific industry, but now I know how crucial data management is for a company to stay competitive.</p>
<h3 id="more-job-satisfaction-and-happier-life">More Job satisfaction and Happier Life</h3>
<p>Startups value your creativity and passion. At startups, your individual contributions can have a big impact on your organization. You grow with your organization and the people you work with as family and friends.  Working with startups, you will have a happier life with endless passion and motivation! I love my work at Mazira and I am sure in the near future Mazira can help more companies to be successful and profitable by transforming data into business opportunities.</p>
